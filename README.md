# StarlightEngine
A small engine utilzing a vulkan rendering backend. This project is a means of exploring real time computer graphics methodologies with Vulkan. The other two portions of the engine are: StarlightCommon and Starlight Core. The core is a header only library which contains shared interfaces between the engine and the core. The engine contains the core rendering services. This layout is likely to change in the future.
